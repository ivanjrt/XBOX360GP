* Once Upon a Time XBOX was born and this was an excellent console, so much so I burned the video chipset.
* XBOX 360, came on and this was a hands down my next console to go to :) , but then it happened, 

Red Ring Of Death, (Faulty by design lol) üèÆüíç‚ò†Ô∏è <br/>
but I didn't give up <br/>

I bought me another used XBOX 360 and it happened again, then I learned how to take it apart and Temporarly fix it by replacing the thermal Paste
eventually even that got old, and it was the End!<br/>

But then I only had a brick and I thought I gve it a 2nd use, and since I like fighting game, I decided I designed my own Stick but I didnt have any machinary
But I did have a XBOX360.<br/>

so I took the idea and I created this:

I designed this when I was just in my early 20s w/o any Electronics background or University or even college
